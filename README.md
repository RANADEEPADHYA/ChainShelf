# 📚 ChainShelf – Blockchain Library System

A transparent and decentralized record-keeping system for library book checkouts and returns — powered by Solidity smart contracts.  

ChainShelf makes managing and tracking books easy, fair, and fully verifiable on the blockchain.  
It’s a perfect beginner-friendly project to understand how real-world systems can be implemented with Web3 technology.

## 🚀 Project Description

**ChainShelf** is a smart contract built on the Celo blockchain that keeps an on-chain record of library books.  
It allows the library owner to **add books**, while users can **borrow** and **return** them.  
Every action (add, borrow, return) is **recorded transparently** on the blockchain so anyone can verify book availability and activity.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Lets the **owner** add new books to the blockchain library.  
- Allows **users** to borrow available books using their wallet address.  
- Ensures **only the borrower** can return a borrowed book.  
- Keeps a **permanent on-chain log** of all checkouts and returns via blockchain events.  

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Add Book** – Only the contract owner can add new books.  
✅ **Borrow Book** – Any user can borrow an available book.  
✅ **Return Book** – Only the borrower can return a borrowed book.  
✅ **Public Transparency** – All book records and transactions are visible on the blockchain.  
✅ **Simple Design** – Easy to understand and extend for beginners learning Solidity.
