# ðŸ“š ChainShelf â€“ Blockchain Library System

A transparent and decentralized record-keeping system for library book checkouts and returns â€” powered by Solidity smart contracts.  

ChainShelf makes managing and tracking books easy, fair, and fully verifiable on the blockchain.  
Itâ€™s a perfect beginner-friendly project to understand how real-world systems can be implemented with Web3 technology.

## ðŸš€ Project Description

**ChainShelf** is a smart contract built on the Celo blockchain that keeps an on-chain record of library books.  
It allows the library owner to **add books**, while users can **borrow** and **return** them.  
Every action (add, borrow, return) is **recorded transparently** on the blockchain so anyone can verify book availability and activity.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Lets the **owner** add new books to the blockchain library.  
- Allows **users** to borrow available books using their wallet address.  
- Ensures **only the borrower** can return a borrowed book.  
- Keeps a **permanent on-chain log** of all checkouts and returns via blockchain events.
